      <p className="text-gray-300">
        Iâ€™m passionate about building modern infrastructure and automation. I specialize in cloud services,
        CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, and DevOps tooling. I love learning and applying new technologies
        to solve real-world problems. Whether it's deploying scalable microservices or writing infrastructure-as-code
        with Terraform, I enjoy building things that work reliably and efficiently.
